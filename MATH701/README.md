Collaborating on GitHub
-----------------------

Lesson for participants in MATH 701, graduate seminar in algorithms at the University of British Columbia math department. 

To install git, see the [install instructions](install_instructions.md).  

For notes on Christina's presentation on how to
 
* clone online repositories
* make local commits
* push commits + submit a pull request
* pull changes from the master online repository

see the appropriate collaboration file for [SmartGit](collaboration_smartgit.md) or [Bash](collaboration_bash.md).  Don't use the GitHub GUI.

For this week's mini-assignment, please follow the directions in the [assignment file](assignment.md).
